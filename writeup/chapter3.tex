\chapter{Problem Analysis}

This chapter contains an analysis of the problem and breaks it down into sub problems. It then sets out the functional and non-functional requirements.

\section{Problem Analysis}
The problem can be broken down into three main components:

\subsection{Video Game Development}
Creating a basic video game involves designing core gameplay mechanics, implementing player controls, creating a game environment, and establishing basic game rules and objectives. 
This requires selecting an appropriate game engine that supports the planned features and performance requirements. 
Core gameplay mechanics and rules must be defined to provide an engaging player experience, while visual assets and user interface elements need implementation to create a cohesive visual identity. 
Player control systems need to be intuitive and responsive, allowing for meaningful interaction with the game world. Finally, clear win/lose conditions need establishment to provide players with goals and motivation.

\subsection{Network Communication Interface}
Connecting an external AI agent to the game requires establishing a reliable communication channel. 
This involves designing a networking protocol that efficiently transmits necessary game state information and receives AI decisions. 
A server-client architecture must be implemented to facilitate this exchange, along with data serialization and parsing mechanisms to ensure proper interpretation of messages on both ends. 
Synchronization between game state and AI agent is critical to maintain consistency, while also managing network latency and potential disconnections to ensure smooth gameplay even under non-ideal network conditions.

\subsection{AI Integration into Gameplay}
Incorporating the AI agent as part of the gameplay loop involves defining the AI's role within the game context, whether as an opponent, ally, or environmental element. 
Interfaces for AI action and observation must be created to allow the AI to both perceive the game state and affect it meaningfully. 
Game state representation needs careful implementation to provide the AI with relevant information in a consumable format. The AI's capabilities must be balanced with player experience to ensure engaging but fair gameplay. 
Additionally, feedback mechanisms must be designed to showcase AI behavior, allowing players to understand and respond to AI actions appropriately.

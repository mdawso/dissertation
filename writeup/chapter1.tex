\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Opening Statement}

Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a significant branch of machine learning, focusing on how intelligent agents ought to take actions in an environment to maximize cumulative rewards. 
Unlike supervised learning, RL does not require labeled training data, but instead learns through interaction with the environment. 
This makes it particularly suitable for domains where explicit instruction is difficult but performance can be measured.

The applications of reinforcement learning span numerous fields including robotics, healthcare, finance, and transportation. 
In robotics, RL enables machines to learn complex motor skills through trial and error. 
In healthcare, it assists in developing personalized treatment regimens. 
Financial institutions employ RL for algorithmic trading strategies, while transportation systems use it for traffic optimization.

Video games provide an ideal testbed for reinforcement learning algorithms due to their controlled environments with clear reward structures.
RL agents have already demonstrated superhuman performance in various games such as classic Atari games.
With this project, I would like to take RL a step further and apply it to more complex gaming environments, evaluating how it handles physics simulation and randomised environments.

\section{Aims of the Project}

The aim of this project is to develop a neural network capable of playing a custom made 2D platformer game, and applying it to a part of the gameplay, such as setting a high score for any given randomly generated map.

\section{Objectives}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Research and understand the fundamentals of reinforcement learning and neural networks.
    \item Design and implement a custom 2D platformer game.
    \item Develop and train a reinforcement learning agent to play the game.
    \item Evaluate the agent's performance in achieving fast times on various maps.
    \item Analyze the results and identify areas for improvement or further research.
\end{itemize}

\section{Project Motivation}

I have chosen this resarch topic because of my passion for gaming and my observation that many video game AIs are either suboptimal or slow in adapting to dynamic environments. 
I believe there is significant room for improvement in this area, and through this research, I aim to contribute to the development of more efficient and intelligent AI systems for gaming. 
This project combines my interests in gaming and artificial intelligence, providing an opportunity to explore innovative solutions and push the boundaries of what game AI can achieve.

\section{Risks}

Scope creep is a potential risk, as the project may expand beyond its initial objectives, leading to delays or incomplete deliverables. 
Interfacing between the AI and the game could also pose challenges, particularly in ensuring seamless communication and data exchange. A
dditionally, training the reinforcement learning agent may require significant computational resources and time, which could impact the project's timeline. 
Finally, debugging and fine-tuning the agent's behavior in a complex and randomized environment may introduce unforeseen difficulties.

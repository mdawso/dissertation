\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank my supervisor Dr Daniel Gardham for being on board with my idea from our first meeting, as well as his continued guidance and support, 
had it not been for him I would likely have picked something much more straightforward and within my comfort zone.
I would also like to thank my friends and family for encouraging me along the development of this project.
Thanks also go to the Godot contributors who work tirelessly, for free, on this wonderful game engine.

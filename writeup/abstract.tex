\chapter*{Abstract}

This dissertation explores deep reinforcement learning in video games by developing a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent for a custom 2D platformer game built with Godot Engine. 
The research implements a DQN architecture combining convolutional neural networks with reinforcement learning to develop game-playing policies without human intervention.
A custom game with randomised maps was developed to test the agent's ability to generalise.
The model was evaluated based on the time it takes to reach the end of a given map.
Experimental results show the DQN agent successfully learned effective strategies, achieving times comparable to human players.
The agent's performance improved with training, demonstrating the potential of deep reinforcement learning in video games.

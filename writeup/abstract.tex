\chapter*{Abstract}

This dissertation explores deep reinforcement learning in video games by developing a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent capable of autonomously playing a custom 2D platformer game. 
The game is built using the Godot, a lightweight open-source game engine, and the model is implemented using the PyTorch deep learning framework.
The model is lightweight enough to run on the CPU, but can be accelerated using a GPU.
Experimental results show the DQN agent successfully learned effective strategies, achieving times comparable to human players.
The agent's performance improved with training, demonstrating the potential of deep reinforcement learning in video games.

this project has two components, a godot project contained in godot_project and a python project contained in python.
to run the python portion of this project you will need to be on windows.

to run the godot project, download godot engine 4.3 from https://godotengine.org/download/archive/4.3-stable/
within godot, import the godot_project folder as a project, it should then appear in the list. double click to open it.
to play the project, press f5 or click the play button in the top right hand corner of the editor

to run the python project you must have python version 3.12.8 with the following packages installed
torch-directml
numpy

the python project is run through the main.py file located in the python folder. I have provided a fully trained model file that you can run.
to run it, run: 
main.py --mode play
this will load the latest checkpoint file located in the same directory as main.py.

then, run the godot project. godot will connect to python when you click "Training/Eval Mode" or "Player Mode" within godot.
I would recommend running it in training/eval mode so the model plays over and over again without stopping.
you must do this each time you want to run it.

if you would like to train a new model, move the model_checkpoint_20000 file to another directory and delete it.
then run:
main.py --mode train
then run godot in training mode as before. The model will run around randomly for a while then begin to converge to a policy. For best results train the model on pillars for 6000-10000 iterations, then snake for 6000-10000 iterations.
this will start creating new checkpoint files within the same directory as main.py, every 1000 iterations

I demonstrate how to run this in the demo video, consult that if you have trouble.
thanks
